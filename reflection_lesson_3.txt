Question:

If I want to colaborate with others or work from a remote computer on my files.



Question:
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Question:
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Answer:
Use fork to copy a repository from one GitHub account into another, clone respository to your local computer to work on it. Inside a repository create a new branch to make changes but keep master branch unaffected.

Question:
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Answer:
You would have to compare and merge files by hand, which would take a lot more time. You also could not collaborate with strangers in open source projects. If you are just working with a few people on one project, you could discuss changes to the project and one of you makes them, which might be easier than using GitHub.



Question:
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

Answer:
You would make changes in a separate branch if these changes are experimental, or need to be reviewed by collaborators before merging them with master.
